MOTIVATION

We both enjoy consuming pizza and we have strong opinions on what constitutes "good" pizza. We figured a database of actual Denver pizzas and reviews corresponding to them was needed. 

App utilizing ActiveRecord with database of Pizza information (restaurant, ingredients, menu name) in the Denver area.* The largest issue we had was with modifying the syntax of inputs to fit the function using the tty-prompt requirements.
